# Racket - Shuttle Tracker

## Introduction
VNIT recently introduced a shuttle service on campus which made conveyance extremely convenient. The shuttles follow pre-defined routes around the campus, but the timing of their arrival and departure from a stop is generally unknown.

Our project, Racket-Shuttle Tracker, aims to work around these issues as well as make it all-the-more comfortable for the people on campus to use.


## Working/Features
- First user needs to Log in/Sign up to the portal.
- While registerring, user needs to enter all the useful information like College Id, Enrollment Number etc.
- After logging in, user will be able to see VNIT map on main screen and select his drop off and pickup location for the trip.

## Future Updates
- History of the user's trip will be visible.

- More information will be present on the profile section if we get access to student database.
- After experimentations, optimum route plan can be devised.
